**700 million people. 1,000+ languages. One mission: ensuring Southeast Asia's voices are heard in the age of AI.**

[SEACrowd](/about) is a community-driven initiative building the future of multilingual and multicultural AI for Southeast Asia. We create open datasets, tools, and models that empower researchers, students, and developers working with low-resource languages and underrepresented communities.

## Why Southeast Asia Needs Your Support

**The problem is urgent**: Despite representing 8.5% of the world's population, Southeast Asia remains dramatically underrepresented in AI development. Most AI systems are built for English and a handful of major languages, leaving hundreds of millions without access to AI that understands their language, culture, and context.

**We're changing that**: Our work includes [SEA-VL](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.916/), the largest vision-language dataset for the region, and comprehensive [resources](/resources) that are freely available to researchers worldwide.

## Your Impact

Your support directly funds:

- 🔬 **Open Research & Infrastructure**
  - Developing cutting-edge datasets and models for 1,000+ Southeast Asian languages
  - Maintaining free, accessible AI resources for the global research community

- 👥 **Community Building**
  - Running [SEACrowd apprentice programs](/apprenticeship) for early-career researchers,
    especially students and those from underrepresented communities
  - Hosting [workshops and conferences](/events) to strengthen regional AI expertise
