title: "üö® SEA-VL Phase 2 - Building Visual Language Models for Southeast Asia: Call for Contributors"
categories: Announcement,Project
---

Welcome! SEA-VL is a global community project organized by the SEACrowd community to push the boundaries of vision and language research in Southeast Asia (SEA). We recently completed Phase 1 of this project with the release of high-quality, culturally relevant image datasets and a benchmarking study for SEA languages, as detailed in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07920).

For Phase 2, we have an even bigger ambition: we want to build an open-source state-of-the-art vision language model (VLM) for Southeast Asia! We believe it‚Äôs high time to create a model that truly understands Southeast Asia culture and language, the way we see it. We want the model to reflect the visual and linguistic richness of the SEA region. This effort requires diverse contributions: high-quality data curation and annotation, prompting, model training, evaluation, and more.

Whether you're a researcher, developer, artist, linguist, photographer, student, or just passionate about Southeast Asia, there's a place for you in this project. Read on below!

## Why Contribute?

Contributing to SEA-VL Phase 2 will give you a chance to work with an international group of researchers who are equally passionate about SEA research.

Your efforts won't go unappreciated! Every contribution to any SEA-VL Phase 2 tasks below will earn points. Reaching 200 or more points guarantees a certificate of participation and merchandise, while reaching 300 or more points earns co-authorship in our final paper.

## How can I contribute?

SEA-VL Phase 2 is split into five main tasks described below. You can contribute to any task that aligns with your interest or expertise.

**Important:** Read the main contributor guidelines  [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Akyd__e3hJdBvJMey69ykSScQJXVMlD0PJNxJf4D-VI/edit?usp=sharing) for more details about the tasks.

If you have any questions about the process, please join our Discord to ask questions.

### Task 1: Submit a SEA Culturally-Relevant Image with Description

To build the vision-language model, we need a compilation of culturally relevant images representing all 11 Southeast Asian countries.

What qualifies as a ‚Äúculturally relevant image‚Äù?

Any image that reflects an aspect of SEA culture is welcome! This could include food and cuisines (e.g., nasi goreng, pho, green curry), locations (e.g., Manila‚Äôs Escolta Street), events (e.g., Lunar New Year festivities), or everyday cultural practices (e.g., eating with your hands). As long as it connects to SEA culture, it‚Äôs a great fit!

You may check this [resource](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SEACrowd/sea-vl_crowdsourcing) to see what images we want for this task.

Go to this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScHKqaNlh-SvTD75AtWKkNhFvPNXXDy1eFyrqy3XGXq7M15Vw/viewform) to submit your images.

### Task 2: Review Image-Description Pairs

To ensure quality images for the dataset used in training the model, we need local annotators to rate the submitted images from Task 1.

Contributors for this task must first pass this [short screening test](https://forms.gle/p1MmJcKtier9tYZT9). Check [our annotation guideline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10VTsoD9Lfh_agxE1doSDjgPD4WsDtElDJJ5u775t68g/edit?usp=sharing)  [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Akyd__e3hJdBvJMey69ykSScQJXVMlD0PJNxJf4D-VI/edit?usp=sharing) to learn more and to apply for the screening test. You will receive a link to the annotation platform if you pass the screening test.

### Task 3: Translate Benchmark Datasets

To ensure the proper evaluation and testing of vision language capabilities, we need help translating prompts from existing vision language model benchmarks, such as the Aya Vision Benchmark by Cohere Labs.

Contributors for this task will translate the English prompts into any one of the following languages in which they are fluent/native speakers:

*Indonesian, Vietnamese, Thai, Malay, Filipino/Tagalog, Lao, Khmer, Tamil, Mandarin Chinese*

We need three contributors per language for this task. Go to this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdbcxgN_sOqDResVkcj3s7IkYTWI8WDV6dZw0mZOIkH7puNSg/viewform?usp=dialog) to contribute.

### Task 4: Submit Visual Questions for Multicultural Images

 To evaluate the visual understanding of the models we will train, we need to compile a dataset of high-quality questions derived from cultural images from SEA.

Contributors for this task will create original questions related to a given image (e.g., ‚ÄúWhat sport is played in this image?‚Äù) in any of the following languages in which they are fluent/native speakers:

*Indonesian, Vietnamese, Thai, Malay, Filipino/Tagalog, Lao, Khmer, Tamil, Mandarin Chinese*

Go to this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdbcxgN_sOqDResVkcj3s7IkYTWI8WDV6dZw0mZOIkH7puNSg/viewform?usp=dialog) to contribute.

### Task 5: Submit High-Quality Text Prompts for Image Generation

 To evaluate the image generation capabilities of the models we will train, we need to compile a dataset of increasingly complex, high-quality English-only prompts.

Contributors to this task will create original English-only text prompts at three levels of complexity anchored in various SEA cultures. To ensure the quality of the prompts, contributors must also be knowledgeable of the general culture in a SEA country.

  

Example prompts for the Indonesian culture:

  

Level 1 (Easy) - *‚ÄúDraw an image of people drinking cendol.‚Äù*

Level 2 (Medium) - *‚ÄúDraw an image of people drinking cendol with durian topping.‚Äù*

Level 3 (Hard) - *‚ÄúDraw an image of people drinking cendol with durian topping while wearing kebaya.‚Äù*

Go to this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdbcxgN_sOqDResVkcj3s7IkYTWI8WDV6dZw0mZOIkH7puNSg/viewform?usp=dialog) to contribute.


### Task 6: Submit High-Quality Text Prompts *(To be opened at a later date)*

## Contribution Point System for Tasks

Each task has its corresponding point-per-submission, calibrated for task difficulty and its relation to a specific SEA country culture.

We give more weight to submissions (e.g., culturally relevant images for Task 1) related to Brunei, East Timor, Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar, as they are heavily underrepresented compared to the other countries. We also want contributors from these countries to reach the contribution threshold faster.
