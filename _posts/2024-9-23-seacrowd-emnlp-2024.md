🎉 Exciting news! SEACrowd's very first publication has been accepted at EMNLP 2024! 🚀

"SEACrowd: A Multilingual Multimodal Data Hub and Benchmark Suite for Southeast Asian Languages" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.10118)

This milestone is a massive leap for AI research in Southeast Asia, and we owe it all to our dedicated 100+ contributors. Your commitment and hard work were pivotal in bringing us to this point. 💪 Also special thanks to AI Singapore who has been very supportive and encouraging for our journey. ❤️

Our first collaboration spanned from Nov 2023 to Jun 2024, with an incredible team of 86 co-authors and 23 contributors. Together, we consolidated 498 datasheets into the SEACrowd Catalogue and standardized 399 dataloaders within the SEACrowd Data Hub, covering 980 out of 1,300+ Southeast Asian languages.

Through our SEACrowd benchmarks, we evaluated AI models across 36 indigenous languages on 13 tasks, offering deep insights into the current AI landscape in Southeast Asia 🌏. Our work also proposes strategies to drive future AI advancements across the region.

Looking ahead, the SEACrowd community is gearing up for even more exciting initiatives! From another crowdsourcing project launching in November 2024 (stay tuned! 😉), to SEA engagement events like Birds-of-a-Feather at EMNLP 2024, and the on-going pilot SEACrowd Apprentice program designed to help aspiring researchers kickstart their journey in AI.

The future of AI in Southeast Asia is brighter with all of us working together! 🌟
