# Welcome to SEACrowd! 👋

We are a community dedicated to bridging the gap between multilingual AI and Southeast Asian AI and enhancing the quality of AI research and researchers in the region.

> See what [indigenous and non-indigenous languages](https://github.com/SEACrowd/seacrowd-datahub/blob/master/LANGUAGES.md) are under our study.

## 🤔 What's Next?

### 🖼️ SEA Visual Instruction

The follow-up to the highly successful *SEACrowd* is here! We are now opening another open-source crowdsourcing initiative, **SEA-VL**, for developing high-quality open-source SEA-specific vision-language datasets and building vision-language models for SEA languages!

SEA-VL is a big initiative which is why we have decided to split it into two phases. In the **Phase One** of SEA-VL, the task is to submit **self-taken culturally-relevant images**, plus descriptions about the shared image. This will be cleaned and compiled into a comprehensive open-access SEA-relevant image dataset. This dataset will be incorporated as the core component of the **Phase Two** where we will build instruction-tuning VL datasets and build a SEA-specific vision language model (VLM) using the constructed dataset.

    <p>You can also participate in this initiative and become a co-author of SEA-VL! For more detail check our [SEA-VL blog post](https://seacrowd.github.io/seavl-launch/)!</p>

### 🌏 Special Interest Group in Southeast Asian NLP (SIGSEA)

SIGSEA aims to change that by promoting research, collaboration, and sharing updates on Southeast Asian NLP. This way, in the future, we also can hold our own SEA workshops & events in ACL conferences! 💪

We're collecting expressions of interest for membership. As a member, you'll receive regular updates on research, events, and opportunities in the region.

Everyone can join (no need for ACL membership). Sign up today to join SIGSEA via [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfNiQ6xSq3yMDMITKbmRvkvjQkznpgO3BFfOHa0957sGnmsbw/viewform)! 🫶

### 🧑‍🎓 SEACrowd Apprentice (Pilot) Program

On-going since 08/2024.

This program targets early-career AI enthusiasts from underserved Southeast Asian communities, who are looking to gain their first substantial research experience. Many face challenges such as limited access to research tools, mentorship, and AI developments.

Our program addresses these gaps by providing research problems for participants to solve in small teams, guided by experienced mentors. Through hands-on projects and learning key concepts, participants work toward writing a publication for top AI conferences like ACL. The program also emphasizes critical thinking, collaboration, and academic writing to prepare participants for success in AI research.
