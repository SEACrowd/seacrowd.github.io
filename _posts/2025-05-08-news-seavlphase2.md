**Please check the project page for information on contributing**: [SEA-VL Phase 2]({% post_url 2025-05-01-project-seavlphase2 %})

Welcome! SEA-VL is a global community project organized by the SEACrowd community to push the boundaries of vision and language research in Southeast Asia (SEA). We recently completed [Phase 1](https://seacrowd.github.io/seavl-dataset/) of this project with the release of high-quality, culturally relevant image datasets and a benchmarking study for SEA languages, as detailed in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07920).

For Phase 2, we have an even bigger ambition: we want to build an open-source state-of-the-art vision language model (VLM) for Southeast Asia! We believe it’s high time to create a model that truly understands Southeast Asia culture and language, the way we see it. We want the model to reflect the visual and linguistic richness of the SEA region. This effort requires diverse contributions: high-quality data curation and annotation, prompting, model training, evaluation, and more.

Whether you're a researcher, developer, artist, linguist, photographer, student, or just passionate about Southeast Asia, there's a place for you in this project. Contributing to SEA-VL Phase 2 will give you a chance to work with an international group of researchers who are equally passionate about SEA research.

Every contribution to any SEA-VL Phase 2 tasks below will earn points. Reaching 200 or more points guarantees a certificate of participation and merchandise (t-shirt and keychain), while reaching 300 or more points will earn co-authorship in the final project paper.
