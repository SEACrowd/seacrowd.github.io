# 🌏 Introducing SEA-VL: The Largest Vision-Language Dataset for Southeast Asia

Dear colleagues and community members,

We’re excited to announce a major milestone from the **SEACrowd** team — the launch of **SEA-VL**, the largest open-source **vision-language (VL) dataset** specifically designed to represent the cultural diversity of **Southeast Asia** 🇧🇳🇰🇭🇹🇱🇮🇩🇱🇦🇲🇾🇲🇲🇵🇭🇸🇬🇹🇭🇻🇳.

## 🔍 Why SEA-VL?

Most vision-language datasets today reflect Western-centric imagery and language, leaving **Southeast Asian cultures underrepresented and misinterpreted**.

**SEA-VL** is our open-source initiative to change that—designed to better represent the languages, traditions, and everyday realities of Southeast Asian communities.

## 📊 Highlights

- 📸 **1.3 million** culturally relevant image-text pairs  
- 🌏 Covers all **11 Southeast Asian countries**  
- 🗃️ **50× larger** than any previous SEA-focused VL dataset  
- 🔗 Hosted on Hugging Face: [Explore SEA-VL](https://huggingface.co/collections/SEACrowd/sea-vl-multicultural-vl-dataset-for-southeast-asia-67cf223d0c341d4ba2b236e7)

## 🛠️ How We Built SEA-VL

We combined several approaches to balance scale with cultural fidelity:

- **Crowdsourcing** — High cultural accuracy, but slow and resource-intensive  
- **Image Crawling** — ~85% cultural relevance and highly scalable  
- **Image Generation** — Still fails to reflect SEA cultures authentically and poses licensing challenges

## 💡 Why This Matters

- ✅ AI trained on SEA-VL understands local contexts, languages, and traditions  
- ✅ Community contributions prevent cultural misrepresentation or erasure  
- ✅ We empower Southeast Asian communities to shape how AI sees the region
