**Please check the project page for information on contributing**: [SEA-VL Phase 1]({% post_url 2025-03-01-project-seavlphase1 %})

Following the success of our [SEACrowd project](https://seacrowd.github.io/seacrowd-emnlp-2024/), we’re excited to announce **SEA-VL**, a new open-source initiative to create high-quality vision-language datasets specifically for Southeast Asian (SEA) languages! We’re calling on contributors to help us build a SEA-specific vision-language model.

SEA-VL is a big initiative, so we have decided to split it into two phases. In **Phase 1** of SEA-VL, we’re looking for self-taken, culturally-relevant images with descriptions about the shared image. This will be cleaned and compiled into a comprehensive open-access SEA-relevant image dataset. This dataset will serve as the foundation for Phase 2, where we’ll develop instruction-tuning VL datasets and build a SEA-specific vision language model (VLM) using the constructed dataset.

Phase 1 is open from **11 Nov 2024 to 15 Feb 2025**. More details about Phase 2 will be shared at the end of Phase 1.
