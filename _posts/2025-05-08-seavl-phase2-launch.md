title: "ðŸš¨ SEA-VL Phase 2 - Building Visual Language Models for Southeast Asia: Call for Contributors"
categories: Announcement,Project
---

Welcome! SEA-VL is a global community project organized by the SEACrowd community to push the boundaries of vision and language research in Southeast Asia (SEA).
We recently completed Phase 1 of this project with the release of high-quality, culturally relevant image datasets and a benchmarking study for SEA languages, as detailed in this paper.

For Phase 2, we have an even bigger ambition: we want to build an open-source state-of-the-art vision language model (VLM) for Southeast Asia!
We believe itâ€™s high time to create a model that truly understands Southeast Asia culture and language, the way we see it.
We want the model to reflect the visual and linguistic richness of the SEA region.
This effort requires diverse contributions: high-quality data curation and annotation, prompting, model training, evaluation, and more.

Whether you're a researcher, developer, artist, linguist, photographer, student, or just passionate about Southeast Asia, there's a place for you in this project.
