Following the success of our [SEACrowd project](https://seacrowd.github.io/seacrowd-emnlp-2024/), weâ€™re excited to announce [**SEA-VL**](https://seacrowd.github.io/seavl-launch/), a new open-source initiative to create high-quality vision-language datasets specifically for Southeast Asian (SEA) languages! Weâ€™re calling on contributors to help us build a SEA-specific vision-language model.

SEA-VL is a big initiative, so we have decided to split it into two phases. In **Phase 1** of SEA-VL, weâ€™re looking for self-taken, culturally-relevant images with descriptions about the shared image. This will be cleaned and compiled into a comprehensive open-access SEA-relevant image dataset. This dataset will serve as the foundation for Phase 2, where weâ€™ll develop instruction-tuning VL datasets and build a SEA-specific vision language model (VLM) using the constructed dataset.

> Phase 1 is open from **11 Nov 2024 to 15 Feb 2025**. More details about Phase 2 will be shared at the end of Phase 1.

## Why Contribute?

As with SEACrowd, every contribution to SEA-VL will earn points. Reaching <u>200 points</u> in Phase 1 will guarantee <u>co-authorship in our publication for ACL 2025</u>.

Live contribution tracking monitor will be open soon!

## How can I contribute?

Phase 1 is split into two main tasks: culturally-relevant image submission and image review. Hereâ€™s how points are awarded:

##### Task 1: Submit a SEA Culturally-Relevant Image (1-2 points per photo)

Submission is simple! Just go to this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScHKqaNlh-SvTD75AtWKkNhFvPNXXDy1eFyrqy3XGXq7M15Vw/viewform) and provide your <u>self-taken, culturally relevant</u> photo with a brief description.

Points:
- 1 point for images from Indonesia, Singapore, and Phillippines
- 1.5 points for images from Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam
- 2 points for images from Brunei, East Timor, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar

Curious about the types of images we've been gathering? Take a look at our [submission monitor](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vS5NgqIAxMvN-9tnEbuYab1IP6eM_IFjwKFhp-Le072jiB_zAYvbFA5Be7b0R3RUH3E-anvXIjPa02p/pubhtml?gid=2004297798&single=true
).

##### Task 2: Review Image-Description Pairs (1 point per review)

To participate in reviewing, contributors must first pass a short test. Details on how to get started will be released by November 25, 2024.

## What Qualifies as a "Culturally-Relevant Image"?

Any image that reflects an aspect of SEA culture is welcome! This could include food (e.g., eating Nasi Goreng), locations (e.g., Manilaâ€™s Escolta Street), events (e.g., Lunar New Year festivities), or cultural day-to-day practices (e.g., eating with hands). As long as it connects to SEA culture, itâ€™s a great fit!

> Only images that you have personally taken are eligible.

All images will be openly licensed under the CC-BY-SA 4.0 license, so please ensure you own full rights to them before submission.

## Project Timeline

Hereâ€™s our schedule for Phase 1:

- 11 Nov 2024: Task 1 - Culturally-Relevant Image Collection opens
- 25 Nov 2024: Task 2 - Culturally-Relevant Image Review opens
- 15 Jan 2025: Contribution ends

## FAQs
1. **Will Phase 1 authorship guarantee authorship in Phase 2?**
- No. Co-authorship in Phase 2 will have its own points system as the tasks will differ from Phase 1. Points from Phase 1 will not carry over.
2. **Can I submit an image I posted online if I still own the copyright?**
- Yes, as long as you took the image and still hold the copyright.
3. **Do images need to be high quality?**
- No, phone-quality images are perfectly acceptable as long as they're not blurry or obstructed.
4. **Can I submit images that reflect SEA culture but were taken outside of SEA?**
- Yes, images taken abroad are welcome if they are culturally relevant.
5. **Do I have to be a resident of the SEA culture represented in the photo I submit?**
- No, you do not.
6. **My native language is not a SEA indigenous language. Can I still submit my SEA culturally-relevant images?**
- Yes, you can select `Other...` as your native language.
7. **Have more questions?**
- Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/XXRHFuvkTA), ask us on `#sea-vl` or `#discussion-forum`, and we'll be happy to help!
