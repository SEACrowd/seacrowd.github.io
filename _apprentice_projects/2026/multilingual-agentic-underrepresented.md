title: "Multilingual Agentic for Underrepresented Regions"
summary: "Build an environment and evaluation benchmark for agentic LLMs in low-resource languages and underrepresented regions."
---

In this work, we address the gap in enabling LLMs with agentic capabilities for low-resource languages and underrepresented regions. Most existing environments and evaluation benchmarks (e.g., Taubench) are Anglocentric, leaving a critical void in assessing performance across diverse linguistic contexts.

This initiative aims to develop a comprehensive environment and evaluation benchmark that measures agentic LLM effectiveness in underrepresented regions, ensuring these technologies are inclusive and accessible to a broader global audience.
