SEACrowd’s 3–4 month apprenticeship (Feb 1 - Jun 30, 2026) pairs experienced researchers with early-career or prospective researchers across Southeast Asia to build models, datasets, and publishable research—with a clear path toward PhD admissions, jobs, and stronger SEA regional capacity. Small, mentored teams work on scoped projects with structured milestones and community support.

Our 2025 cohort featured three apprentice teams who successfully completed their projects, culminating in mentees’ first-authored research papers published at the prestigious [5th Multilingual Representation Learning Workshop (2025)](https://sigtyp.github.io/ws2025-mrl.html).

For SEACrowd Apprentice 2026, we offer five cutting-edge research topics relevant to linguistic enrichment, inference optimization, knowledge retention, multilingual agentic systems, and multimodal distillation.
