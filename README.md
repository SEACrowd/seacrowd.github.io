# SEACrowd Website
Brand new SEACrowd website! Theme is based on a modified version of the [Kording lab page](http://kordinglab.com/). 

## Run the page locally using Jekyll

To run locally, make sure you have ruby installed (managed through [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) preferred) then run the following:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

The site should show up on `localhost:4000`
