We’re excited to present a major milestone from the **SEACrowd** team: the launch of
[**SEA-VL**](https://seacrowd.github.io/seavl-launch/), the largest open-source vision-language (VL)
dataset specifically designed to represent the cultural diversity of **Southeast Asia**
🇧🇳🇰🇭🇹🇱🇮🇩🇱🇦🇲🇾🇲🇲🇵🇭🇸🇬🇹🇭🇻🇳.

### Why SEA-VL?

Most vision-language datasets today reflect Western-centric imagery and language, leaving
**Southeast Asian cultures underrepresented and misinterpreted**. SEA-VL is our open-source
initiative to change that. It is designed to better represent the languages, traditions, and
everyday realities of Southeast Asian communities.

Highlights of the dataset include:

- **1.3 million** culturally relevant image-text pairs
- Covers all **11 Southeast Asian countries**
- **50× larger** than any previous SEA-focused VL dataset
- Hosted on Hugging Face:

### How We Built SEA-VL

We combined several approaches to balance scale with cultural fidelity:

- **Crowdsourcing** — High cultural accuracy, but slow and resource-intensive
- **Image Crawling** — ~85% cultural relevance and highly scalable
- **Image Generation** — Still fails to reflect SEA cultures authentically and poses licensing
  challenges

### What's Next?

We extend our deepest thanks to the contributors across Southeast Asia who made this possible.

This is only the beginning: Phase 2 is on the horizon, and we invite researchers, practitioners, and
community members to collaborate with us. Stay tuned on our Discord!
