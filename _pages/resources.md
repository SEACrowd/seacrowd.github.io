Southeast Asia is home to more than 1,000 native languages. Nevertheless, Southeast Asian NLP, vision-language, and speech processing is underrepresented in the research community, and one of the reasons is the lack of access to public datasets ([Aji et al., 2022](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.500/)).
It is essential to greatly increase the accessibility of SEA datasets, promote research in SEA languages and cultures, as well as build more AI models that represent SEA.

We consolidate a [comprehensive resource hub](https://seacrowd.github.io/seacrowd-catalogue/) that fills the resource gap by [providing standardized corpora](https://github.com/SEACrowd/seacrowd-datahub) in nearly 1,000 Southeast Asian (SEA) languages across three modalities. Find their standardized dataloaders [here](https://github.com/SEACrowd/seacrowd-datahub).

Furthermore, we also build [SEACrowd benchmarks](https://github.com/SEACrowd/seacrowd-experiments) to assess the quality of AI models on 36 indigenous languages across 13 tasks, offering valuable insights into the current AI landscape in SEA. Furthermore, we propose strategies to facilitate greater AI advancements, maximizing potential utility and resource equity for the future of AI in SEA.
