**Please check the project page for information on contributing**: [SEA-VL Phase
2]({{ '/projects/2025-seavl-phase-1/' | relative_url }})

Following the success of our [SEACrowd project](https://seacrowd.github.io/seacrowd-emnlp-2024/),
we’re excited to announce **SEA-VL**, a new open-source initiative to create high-quality
vision-language datasets specifically for Southeast Asian (SEA) languages!
We’re calling on contributors to help us build a SEA-specific vision-language model.

SEA-VL is a big initiative, so we have decided to split it into two phases.
In **Phase 1** of SEA-VL, we’re looking for self-taken, culturally-relevant images with descriptions
about the shared image.
This will be cleaned and compiled into a comprehensive open-access SEA-relevant image dataset.
This dataset will serve as the foundation for Phase 2,
where we’ll develop instruction-tuning VL datasets and
build a SEA-specific vision language model (VLM) using the aid dataset.

Phase 1 is open from **11 Nov 2024 to 15 Feb 2025**. More details about Phase 2 will be shared
at the end of Phase 1.
