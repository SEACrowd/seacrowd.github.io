As part of our ongoing commitment to improve SEA AI, we believe that mentorship of early-career
researchers is one of the most important avenues we must take to ensure that growth in the region is
sustainable.

The apprenticeship program is a short 3-4 month internship where experienced researchers mentor
early-career or prospective researchers. Expected outputs include models, datasets, and published
peer-reviewed papers which will hopefully lead to PhD acceptance letters, job placements, and more.
