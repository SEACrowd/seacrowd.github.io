## 🤔 What's Next?

### 🖼️ SEA Visual Instruction

We will launch our new project in early Nov 2024 (11/2024). [Stay tuned!](https://seacrowd.github.io/contact/)

### 🌏 Special Interest Group in Southeast Asian NLP (SIGSEA)

SIGSEA aims to change that by promoting research, collaboration, and sharing updates on Southeast Asian NLP. This way, in the future, we also can hold our own SEA workshops & events in ACL conferences! 💪

We're collecting expressions of interest for membership. As a member, you'll receive regular updates on research, events, and opportunities in the region.

Everyone can join (no need for ACL membership). Sign up today to join SIGSEA via [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfNiQ6xSq3yMDMITKbmRvkvjQkznpgO3BFfOHa0957sGnmsbw/viewform)! 🫶

### 🧑‍🎓 SEACrowd Apprentice (Pilot) Program

On-going since 08/2024.

This program targets early-career AI enthusiasts from underserved Southeast Asian communities, who are looking to gain their first substantial research experience. Many face challenges such as limited access to research tools, mentorship, and AI developments.

Our program addresses these gaps by providing research problems for participants to solve in small teams, guided by experienced mentors. Through hands-on projects and learning key concepts, participants work toward writing a publication for top AI conferences like ACL. The program also emphasizes critical thinking, collaboration, and academic writing to prepare participants for success in AI research.
