# ðŸš¨ SEA-VL: Call for Contributors

The follow-up to [the highly successful *SEACrowd* project](https://seacrowd.github.io/seacrowd-emnlp-2024/) is here! We are now opening another open-source crowdsourcing initiative, **SEA-VL**, for developing high-quality open-source SEA-specific vision-language datasets and building vision-language models for SEA languages!

SEA-VL is a big initiative which is why we have decided to split it into two phases. In the **Phase 1** of SEA-VL, the task is to submit and review **self-taken culturally-relevant images**, plus descriptions about the shared image. This will be cleaned and compiled into a comprehensive open-access SEA-relevant image dataset. This dataset will be incorporated as the core component of the **Phase 2** where we will build instruction-tuning VL datasets and build a SEA-specific vision language model (VLM) using the constructed dataset.

Phase 1 will be open from 11 Nov 2024 to 15 Feb 2024. Details about Phase 2 will be added near the end of Phase 1.

### What's in it for me?

Like the previous SEACrowd project, contributions will be rewarded with points. Achieving **200 points** in Phase 1 will guarantee you a co-authorship in our publication for ACL 2025.

> Live contribution tracking monitor will be open soon!

### How can I contribute?

We divide the **Phase 1** into two tasks: image submission and image review, each task follow the following scoring standard:

##### Task 1: Submit a SEA culturally-relevant self-photo (1-2 points depending on where the photo is taken)

Submitting is easy! Simply access this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScHKqaNlh-SvTD75AtWKkNhFvPNXXDy1eFyrqy3XGXq7M15Vw/viewform) and fill in the required details.

- 1 point for each self-taken culturally-relevant image from **Indonesia**, **Singapore**, and **Phillippines**
- 1.5 points for each self-taken culturally-relevant images from **Thailand**, **Malaysia**, and **Vietnam**
- 2 points for each self-taken culturally-relevant images from **Brunei**, **EastTimor**, **Cambodia**, **Laos**, **Myanmar**

##### Task 2: Review an image-caption pair (1 point per instance)
For reviewing, have the reviewer candidates pass a short test first. Details are coming soon by **25 Nov 2024**.

### What is a "culturally-relevant image"?

Any image containing a subject relevant to your culture is accepted. For example, this can be food (e.g., a photo of someone eating Nasi Goreng), places (e.g., a scene from Escolta Street in Manila), events (e.g., Chinese New Year celebration in your country), day-to-day life with culture-specific things (e.g., eating with hands), and many more. As long as it contains something that's related to SEA culture, you can submit it.

### Can I submit images from the internet?
**No.** Images have to be strictly taken by you.

Any images you provide will be later licensed under the open-source CC-BY-SA 4.0 license. Please make sure that the photos you submit do not belong to anyone else.

### Timeline

Here is our schedule for Phase 1!

- 11 Nov 2024: Launch Task 1 (Culturally-Relevant Self-Photo Collection)
- 25 Nov 2024: Launch Task 2 (Culturally-Relevant Image Review)
- 15 Jan 2025: End of self-photo review period
- 15 Feb 2025: Round 1 publication deadline (ACL 2025)

## FAQs
1. **The project has two phases. Does authorship in Phase One also guarantee authorship in Phase 2?** -- No. The points system for both phases will be different as both will involve different tasks. Points from Phase One will also not carry over into the next one.
2. **I have an image that is self-taken but I posted it on the internet before. Is this OK?** -- Yes, this is OK as long as (1) you took the image and (2) you did not release copyright to anyone else.
3. **Do the images have to be professional-quality?** -- No. Images from your phone are fine.
4. **I have images taken abroad that are culturally-releavant but they are not my culture. Is this OK?** -- Yes, this is OK. 
5. **I have other questions!** -- Please join our Discord server and let's discuss there!
